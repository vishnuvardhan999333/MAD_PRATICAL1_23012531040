1.8.	Working with Arrays: Explore array operations such as Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString(), IntArray.joinToString(), and use them to print arrays. Utilize various loop types like range, downTo, until, etc., to manipulate arrays. Sort an array of integers both without using built-in functions and with built-in functions.

1.10. Class and Constructor Creation: Define different classes and constructors. Create a "Car" class with properties like type, model, price, owner, and miles driven. Implement functions to get car information, original car price, current car price, and display car information

1.11. Operator Overloading and Matrix Operations: Explain operator overloading and implement matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication using a "Matrix" class. Overload the toString() function in the "Matrix" class for customized output.
